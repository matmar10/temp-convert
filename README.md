Problem Statement
-----------------

From Kevin Rogers:

> A simple .html file with the code is all that is required.  He can either pass it through you or email me directly.
> 
> Programming Problem: 
> Create a simple GUI that will allow a person to convert a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit and back. 
>  
> Assume that the conversion is:  Celsius = (Fahrenheit â€“ 32) / 1.8. 
>  
> The goal of this exercise is for the result to give us some confidence in your coding style and abilities.  To that end, creating a class or set of methods/functions that provides a way to make future improvements might be a good idea.  For example, supporting a general Temperature class that can handle the conversion now, and later other temperature stuff for the larger weather site.  Also there might be some helpers that allow for input and output that is not just a plain decimal number, e.g. 34F might be the input or the desired output, which is different from what would be used in the actual calculation.  Do not spend more than 1 hour or so on it, but if you can make sure it works, that is a plus.
